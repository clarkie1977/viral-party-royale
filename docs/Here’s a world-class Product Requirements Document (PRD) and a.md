- **Title:** Viral Party Royale
- **Elevator Pitch:**  
  A fast-paced, microgame party for 20+ players, where each round is a random, 30-second minigame (think WarioWare x Fall Guys). Players are instantly eliminated if they lose, with FOMO-inducing, limited-time cosmetics for winners. The last player standing wins the round.
